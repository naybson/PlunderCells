🚢 Plunder Cells — Pirate-Themed Terminal Battleship With Brains

Plunder Cells is my twist on the classic Battleship game, built as part of my first university programming project.
This be no ordinary board game rerun — this one be forged in pure C, powered by the Windows terminal, and seasoned with salty pirate vibes.

🦜 Features
-Colorful ASCII board with clean visuals
-Pirate-themed UI and game flow (yarrr ⚓)
-Manual ship placement with rotation & grid previews
-Four AI difficulty levels from clueless cabin-boy to tactical sea demon
-Scoreboard with player names
-Hit/miss animations & terminal effects
-Classic C madness — input validation, loops, structs, oh my

💻 Platform Notes

⚠️ Built for Windows Command Prompt.
This project uses Windows-specific terminal commands and may misbehave on Linux or macOS.

🎯 Project Goal
-This was my first big coding assignment in university, and it taught me:
-How to build a full game loop in C
-Terminal UI tricks
-Writing modular game logic
-Designing basic AI that actually gives you a challenge

I kept the pirate theme because… why not?
If you're gonna sink ships, you might as well do it like a captain.
